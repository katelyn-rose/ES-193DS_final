# ES-193DS_final

This is my final exam for ENVS 193DS. 

There are two problems, the first one analyzes a data set on kangaroo rat mounds and seed counts. The second problem looks at flower phylogeny in changing tundra biomes. 

All code can be found in the code folder and the rendered html of the exam can be found [here!](https://katelyn-rose.github.io/ES-193DS_final/code/final.html)
